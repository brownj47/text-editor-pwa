#  PWA Text Editor!

## Description

This application is a text editor for the browser. It is a Progressive Web Application, and can be used offline. It uses caching, service workers, and webpack.

In this project, I wanted to learn about the structure behind modern front-end frameworks like React. The new technologies made for a bit of a struggle, but eventually they became less obtuse.
